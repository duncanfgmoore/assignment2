        <p>My name is Duncan Moore. Unlike probably most of the people in the class I am not originally from Minnesota.
           I spent most of my time growing up in Western New York. After graduating from the University of Guelph (if you 
           need me to pronounce it I would be more than happy to) I wanted to mix it up a bit and try something new and foriegn. 
           I decided to take the leap of faith and head out to Minnesota.
        </p>

        <p> After I graduated from school I was not sure what I wanted to do for a career. I kept coming back to the tect industry.
            I have always had an interest in the tech work and enjoyed problem solving/solving puzzles. From my research it sounds like 
            web development falls perfectly into those genereal interests. I look forward to learning about the coding world from this course
            and am exctied about the possiblity of being a web developer.
